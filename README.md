CakePHP 2 is a very ancient thing, what I need to inspect immediately.

## Features 

- Go to definition to the dynamic classes (controllers, models and components).

## Development

```sh
npm run prettier -- --write .
```

## Publish

Publishing is automatically done when a tag which starts with `v` is added.
